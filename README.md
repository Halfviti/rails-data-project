This project will consume data from `SWAPI: The Star Wars API` and build a navigable web-site from it`. The data will be used to model characters/roles and movie appearances as well as planets and species.

The models/tables will be as follows






    
  
Film          | Character | Appearances  | Planet          | Species        |

episode_id    | homeworld | film_id      | rotation_period | classification |
opening_crawl | films     |              | orbital_period  | designation    |
